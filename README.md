# Recreated C Library Functions - 42-cursus-libft

This repository contains a program built with C, Makefile, file descriptors, and Shell that recreates several C library functions. The program utilizes these technologies to implement custom versions of commonly used C library functions, providing a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms and functionality.

Technologies Used

C
C is a powerful programming language known for its efficiency and low-level control. It provides direct access to memory and system resources, making it suitable for systems programming. In this project, C is used to recreate C library functions and understand their inner workings.

Makefile
Makefile is a build automation tool used to compile and build software projects. It allows defining dependencies, compiling rules, and automating the build process. In this project, Makefile is used to compile the C program and generate the executable.

File Descriptor
A file descriptor is an abstract indicator used to access files or input/output resources in Unix-like operating systems. It represents an open file or a communication endpoint. In this project, file descriptors are used to handle input/output operations for the recreated C library functions.

Shell
Shell scripting is a way to automate tasks using command-line interpreters. It provides a scripting language to execute commands, manipulate files, and perform various system operations. In this project, Shell scripting is used to run and control the execution of the recreated C library functions program.
